# RBM-Recommender
Movie recommendation using Restricted Boltzmann Machine

In this project, we implemented a movie recommender system using a Restrctied Boltzmann Machine
and analyzed our performance against other common algorithms (Baseline, SVD, SVD++, KNN) using
the Netflix challenge movie dataset.

We also did some simple data analysis on the dataset and observed a few trends, some of which
were predictable and straightforward, but some are also interesting.
