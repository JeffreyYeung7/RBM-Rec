Movie recommendation using Restricted Boltzmann Machine

In this project, we implemented a Restricted Boltzmann Machine based movie recommender
using the Netflix challenge movie dataset.

We also compared the performances of several other high performing algorithms cited in the
paper by the winners of the Netflix challenge using the Surprise library. Namely, we
compared the differences between Baseline, SVD, SVD++, and KNN.

We also did some simple data analysis on the dataset and observed a few trends, some of which
were predictable and straightforward, but some are also interesting.
